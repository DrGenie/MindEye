      <h2>Project Context &amp; Benefits</h2>
      <p>
        The MindEye project is an innovative hybrid clinical assessment tool designed for mental health care.
        We integrate artificial intelligence, eye-tracking, and behavioural modelling through discrete choice experiments (DCEs) so that
        MindEye objectively captures how individuals process treatment information and what their preferences are.
        In simple terms, the tool uses your webcam (or in our demo, your mouse movements) to simulate where you “look”
        when you review treatment options, and it asks you to choose between realistic scenarios. The resulting data—both your choices
        and how you looked at each option—helps clinicians understand your priorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The benefits are manifold. For patients, the tool provides a personalised assessment that captures not only symptoms but also your decision style.
        For clinicians, it offers a new, objective method to complement traditional assessments. For policy makers,
        integrating such tools into care may lead to better-targeted interventions, potentially reducing treatment costs and improving outcomes.

      <h2>How to Use MindEye</h2>
      <p>
        In this demo, you will first see a live video feed (using your webcam) with an overlay, which simulates real-time eye-tracking.
        Since actual eye-tracking hardware is not used here, we mimic this by capturing mouse movements over the video area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, the tool will present you with a series of discrete choice questions about mental health treatment scenarios.
        These questions are designed to gauge your treatment preferences—for example, whether you would choose a treatment that acts quickly
        but has more side effects or one that acts more slowly but is gentler.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your responses and simulated gaze data will be recorded and later summarised in graphs. The results are interpreted,
        explaining what your choices and visual focus imply about your priorities.

    <!-- Policy Meaning Tab -->
    <section id="policy" class="tab-content hidden">
      <h2>Meaning for Policy &amp; Clinical Practice</h2>
      <p>
        The results from MindEye can inform policy by highlighting how patients value different treatment outcomes. In our simulation:
      </p>
      <p>
        • If a patient consistently opts for a treatment with a rapid onset despite higher risks (Option A), this suggests a strong desire to address symptoms immediately, even if there are trade-offs in side effect profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Conversely, if a patient chooses a slower onset with minimal side effects (Option B) when given the opportunity, it indicates a preference for quality-of-life and long-term well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        By aggregating these individual preferences, policy makers can better design healthcare services and reimbursement models that favour patient-centred care.
        For instance, if a significant portion of patients prefers long-term benefit over immediate relief, funding may be better allocated to therapies with durable outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the objective eye-tracking data helps confirm whether patients are thoroughly engaging with treatment information. A high degree of visual focus on critical data suggests that patients are making informed choices,
        which can be used to advocate for decision-support tools in clinical practice.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Dynamic Recommendations Tab -->
    <section id="dynamic" class="tab-content hidden">
      <h2>Dynamic Recommendations for Clinicians</h2>
      <p>
        The ultimate goal of MindEye is not only to capture patient preferences but also to generate dynamic recommendations that inform clinical decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on both the recorded discrete choices and the gaze patterns, the AI engine can suggest tailored treatment options. For example,
        if the data indicates that a patient’s attention is strongly drawn to long-term benefits and they repeatedly choose options that favour sustained improvement,
        the system may recommend treatment strategies known for durable outcomes. In contrast, if a patient consistently opts for rapid relief despite higher side effects,
        the recommendation might lean toward a more aggressive or fast-acting intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
        These dynamic recommendations can be used by clinicians as a second opinion. They bring objective insight into a patient's decision process,
        support shared decision-making, and may ultimately lead to more personalised and effective mental health care. As further clinical trials are conducted,
        the recommendation engine will become more refined and further validated.
